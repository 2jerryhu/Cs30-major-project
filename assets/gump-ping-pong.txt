For some reason ping pong became very natural to me so I started playing all the time I played ping pong even when I didn't have anyone to play ping pong with, the hospital people said it made me look like a "duck in water" whatever that means, even Lieutenant Dan would come watch me play I played ping pong so much, I even played ping pong in my sleep
