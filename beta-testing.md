## CS Person Feedback
1. Overall, I feel that your project is very well polished. All of the visual feedback relating to text changing colour depending on whether it was typed right or wrong was a really nice touch. My feedback might be biased as a whole since I enjoy typing, but I really like what you have done here
2. there's a bug (or a feature idk) where if you only type one character and let the timer run down, the WPM bar won't update and it'll remain as infinity
3. There's another bug where if you start a test, let's say as a random prompt, you can switch the selection on the left to text quote mid-test which will pause the timer from running down.
4. Similarly, you can also switch between sudden death mode and not sudden death mode mid-test, which leads to a bunch of fun bugs!
4.1 This is kind of a convoluted bug, but if you start a sudden death test, get a few words right, mess up, restart a regular non-sudden-death test, mess up a few words, and then press ctrl + backspace, the vertical bar will duplicate, with one jumping ahead by some space. 
4.2 nvm the ctrl backspace thing is just broken in general. If you type one wrong letter then type the rest of everything write without deleting, everything will show up as red. This part is probably a feature, but if you press ctrl + backspaace again, then the vertical bar jumps ahead again.
5. I would really appreciate it if there were some keyboard shortcut for restarting the test. 
6. maybe also add something that checks if two words appear consecutively. From my experience with the actual monkeytype, I find that they never have two of the same words next to each other
7. If you have time, I would suggest you add a global leaderboard so that multiple people can compete with another.

## Non-CS Person Feedback
- Interesting content, good length for every paragraph. 
- Really creative thoughts on the modes. Good idea about the Instant Death Mode.
- I like how it shows the result of WPM and accuracy, and the leaderboard shows the comparison to the previous tries
- The insertion point is a bit delayed sometimes, especially when the WPM is above 85.
