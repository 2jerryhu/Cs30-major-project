# Reflection

I am quite happy with what I accomplished over the last 2 months. I succesfully figured out all the typing logic, and implemented a few modes as well. Other than the final weekend, I had a steady pace of work throughout the duration of the project. I worked on all of the typing mechanisms up until the beginning of June, and added the finishing touches in the last few weeks. I learned a lot about problem solving, and how to overcome problems with less code, and not by adding a hundred if statements.

I accomplished everything on my "needs to have" list. I have a statistics page, various modes, local storage system, a variety of prompts, and (hopefully) easy to use UI. However, I did not get to my "nice to have" list. I did not touch adding a multiplayer system. If I had an extra week worth of time, I could've added a customizable UI and more typing modes to my game. 

The one thing I wished I figured out was the timer system. I started working on the timer during the final weekend, and there were too many bugs to properly use it. I was very close to removing all the bugs, but unfortunately I did not have enough time. 

The main problems I encountered was having too much code, which made it so I forgot what most of it did. Writing logic in a few lines proved challenging, and I mainly used booleans and states to solve this problem. For example, the letter color logic was orignally extremely convoluted, until I figured out how to get it working with state variables. 

Overall, I'm happy with what I accomplished with my time. I could've added more with extra time, but I likely wouldn't have figured out multiplayer any time soon. I learned a lot over the last 2 months, and suprsingly I didn't procrastinate everything until the last minute. That might have been the most impressive accomplishment...
